step toward standards the dascp is a strategic road map, aiming to provide the industry with a proposal on how das can be managed, regulated, and scaled. such a strategic road map paves the way for standards by: forging a common language: a shared understanding of terminology and concepts is a cornerstone of effective standardization. enabling regulatory clarity: developed in collaboration with bcg, which reviewed over 100 regulations and engaged with more than 20 key market participants to ensure alignment with both existing and emerging global regulatory frameworks. this clarity in regulation is critical for the advancement of das. providing a blueprint for industry-wide alignment: developing the capabilities to form an aligned perspective on controls is essential for subsequent industry-wide alignment processes. the principles act as a guiding force in the subsequent phases of das adoption, ensuring that standards reflect the collective insights of the entire industry. building the digital asset securities ecosystem 15 case study: translating the dascp framework is designed for flexibility, allowing organizations to adapt high-level controls to their specific

asset manager issues a private security, such as a private equity fund, which is then tokenized on a private blockchain by a custodian. 2 token transfer: the custodian moves the newly created pe private equity tokens from the private ledger to a public-permissioned ledger for wider distribution. 3 kyc enforcement: as tokens are distributed, kyc compliance checks are performed to ensure all investors meet regulatory standards, despite the change in blockchain. 4 money market fund mmf issuance: in parallel, an asset manager issues a money market fund. 5 mmf tokenization for lending: the custodian tokenizes the mmf shares and makes them available for lending in the securities lending market. 6 collateral deposit: investors with tokenized pe fund shares deposit these tokens into the lending pool to serve as collateral. 7 lending pool transactions: using the collateral provided, investors borrow more liquid assets e.g., mmf shares from the lending pool. 8 automated lending operations: the lending process, powered by smart contracts, automates the workflow, including the deposit, loan issuance, and approval, and upon maturity, manages repayment and interest distribution and returns the securities to their original owners. building the digital asset securities ecosystem 18 the chart below presents a detailed illustration of the dascp controls in action, delineating

building the digital asset securities ecosystem 20 next steps in the customizations within the community, we aim to accelerate the adoption and enhance the effectiveness evolution of the dascp of the dascp across diverse financial ecosystems. to foster open dialogue and collective intelligence, we intend to engage the industry through a series of in-depth discussions involving key stakeholders from across the financial sector. these exchanges will serve as a platform to share insights and best practices, as well as to collaboratively address the concerns and challenges faced by various players in implementing the control principles. also, we plan to transition the stewardship of the dascp to an industry association, ensuring its continuous enhancement and compliance with global regulations. industry associations play a pivotal role in uniting market participants around common goals. this strategic move not only guarantees continuous improvement and expansion of the dascp but also empowers the association to leverage it as a foundational document. this will facilitate the integration of secondary trading risks and controls, and the development of additional standards to

control taxonomy the detailed descriptions of risks and controls, as well as a view on which risks are mitigated by which controls, is shown below. detailed risk description: to enhance the effectiveness of our framework, each risk is aligned with one of six principles, ranked from highest to lowest priority. 1 legal certainty is deemed the most urgent, while 6 operational scalability is considered the least. this ranking does not diminish the importance of any principle, as all are required to establish a vibrant das ecosystem. when a risk could be associated with multiple principles, it is assigned to the principle of highest priority. by doing so, we not only ensure a concise framework presentation but also prioritize the risk management process. detailed controls
